## Secure data movement across Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift using role chaining and ASSUMEROLE

The redshift-onboarding-role.cf.yaml and redshift-tenant-resources.cf.yaml are two sample CloudFormation templates used by the AWS blog [Secure data movement across Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift using role chaining and ASSUMEROLE](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/secure-data-movement-across-amazon-s3-and-amazon-redshift-using-role-chaining-and-assumerole/). In this post, we explore how to achieve resource isolation, data security, scaling to multiple tenants, and fine-grained access control at the individual user level for teams that access, store, and move data across storage using Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.
